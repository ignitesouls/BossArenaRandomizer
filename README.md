Boss Arena Randomizer (Beta)

The Boss Arena Randomizer (BAR) lets you create custom boss and arena combinations with improved logic for randomization.
It’s designed to work alongside TheFifthMatt’s Item and Enemy Randomizer
, using the same boss and enemy IDs to ensure compatibility.

Features

🎲 Custom Options Presets – Create or load your own configuration files for maximum flexibility.

🏟 Arena Selection – Choose specific arenas, use presets, or save your own custom arena sets.

⚖️ Boss Selection – Pick bosses manually, or rely on curated presets.

⚙️ Advanced Options

- Clear Arenas: Replace common arena enemies with Springhares to reduce RNG.
