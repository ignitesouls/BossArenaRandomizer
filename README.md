This is a Beta version of the Boss Arena Randomizer in which users can now make their own options files with better logic for Randomizing Bosses and their Arenas. 

Starting:

Select an Options file and Load it. 
	You can manually place your own new options files in the `Options` folder. To do this you must first Create and export Options file From the Fifth Matt's Randomizer: for example it should be list off like this: `example.randomizeopt`)

Select the Arenas or Bosses that you want manually or by presets. 
	You have the ability to make your own preset and load it.
	Note: They must be located under the specified Presets folder.

Click Randomize and then import the options file to the Item and Enemy Randomizer. 

By Default bosses shouldn't appear in arenas they can escape from or fly out of.

`Better Arenas` Places Squirrels in problematic Arenas
`Size Restrictions` Makes stricter restrictions in what bosses can go in arenas base on size
`Difficulty Curve` Prevents some difficult bosses from appearing in early arenas

You can also customize the Bosses and Arenas to your Liking under the Data Folder

Bonus: You are able to Change the Leda Fight to be Bosses instead of NPCs
